  <h1>Affilyst â€“ Smart Affiliate Insights</h1>
  <p><strong>Developed by SÃ©rgio Melo</strong></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ“Œ Overview</h2>
    <p>Affilyst is a personal tool designed to help affiliate marketers identify the best products to promote based on real data from the Google Ads API and AI-generated keyword suggestions. This tool is <strong>not public</strong>, <strong>not for sale</strong>, and is created solely for personal use in running <strong>real ad campaigns using Google Ads</strong> to promote affiliate products.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ§  How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The user uploads a <code>.csv</code> file containing product data (title, description, commission, score, and temperature).</li>
      <li>For each description, the tool uses ChatGPT (via the OpenAI API) to generate about 15 potential sales keywords.</li>
      <li>These keywords are sent <strong>in manual and controlled batches</strong> to the Google Ads API (Keyword Planner) to retrieve metrics such as CPC, search volume, and competition.</li>
      <li>The user analyzes the data and decides which products and keywords are most promising to invest in <strong>real paid campaigns on Google Ads</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ”’ Policy Compliance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All processes are <strong>user-controlled and moderated</strong>, with no mass automation or scraping.</li>
      <li>The tool operates <strong>within the daily quota limits</strong> of the Google Ads API.</li>
      <li><strong>No resale, sharing, or exposure of API data</strong> to third parties.</li>
    </ul>
